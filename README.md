This project was created as part of interview.

You can start the project by using command line:

1. npm i
2. npm start

\*Updating code is on the way:

1. delete react props (useState) and use redux instead
2. make adapt version
3. show\hide appropriate bars depende on value (zero\ non-zero) of items
